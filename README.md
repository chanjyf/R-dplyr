# R-dplyr

Dplyr is from Tidyverse package I will show some powerful verbs from its package and I will use ggplot2movies as database
I will show you that you can do some ETL using R

You can use other databases I just took this one because it's from gglot2 package so everybody can have the same data. The verbs will be the same.
